## About

I love to create and make things and this is a place I use for experimentation, to write notes about online experiences, as a reference and an external memory.

I’m currently living in Berne, Switzerland. I hold a master of science from the University of Bern, where I studied Cognitive Psychology (Human Computer Interaction) and Computer Sciences.
I’m especially interested in all things interactive, be it on the web, in art or sound.
Besides bits and bytes I have a love for soccer, music, art & movies.

At present I work as Lead Frontend Architect at CS of SWISSTXT where I help to design and develop online experiences for some of Switzerland's top most popular sites. Occasionally, I do some consulting.

You'll find some side projects I made at [cityclash.org](http://www.cityclash.org), [cocomoshi.ch](http://www.cocomoshi.ch) or if you'd like to go back in time at [onmodular.com](http://www.onmodular.com) (2002).

Thanks for passing by!

AH. Andreas Hulstkamp
