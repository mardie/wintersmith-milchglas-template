I created a new custom [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/) template called _Milchglas_ for this site (Wintersmith is a great and flexible static site generator, which I use for this blog)

The new template is based on my previous [_Snowboot_ - template](/articles/wintersmith-blog/) but is compatible with Wintersmith version 2.0.*. It
has some additional features like paging on article pages, further readings, a tag- and timebased index and pays more attention to SEO-stuff and page speed.

This template uses some [lovely SVG-Icons licensed from ikonome](http://ikono.me/category/icons/)<sup>1</sup> and nice and clean [pure-css](http://purecss.io) to base its styles on.
A little template-scripting provides the additional features and a couple of media-queries make it (hopefully) adapt well to mobile devices (this still needs testing though).
